# top_calculator

A fully functional calculator as part of The Odin Project! Check it out here:

Notable bugs: using the keyboard feature and trying to chain operators will lead to inaccurate results. 
By design, the calculator can only operate on two operands at a time. If you try to operate on less than that, you will get 
an error message and it will automatically reset all values for you. 

Here's what it looks like on desktop:
